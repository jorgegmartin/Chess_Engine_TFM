# Development of a chess engine using Neural Networks and python
----
## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an engine capable of playing chess on its own. For this, it is necessary to train a neural network on known data and teach it to evaluate positions that occur naturaly on a chess game.

All the notebooks have been written using python as only programming language.
